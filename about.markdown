## My Developer Journey

Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve had a deep fascination with technology. I spent hours tinkering with my father and his **Commodore 64**, learning **BASIC** and dreaming about the endless possibilities that coding offered. It was in those moments that my love for technology first took root, and from then on, I knew I wanted to create and build.

This early passion eventually led me to pursue a degree as an **Electronic and Electrotechnical Technician**, specializing in **Telecommunications**, and I earned my **Cisco CCNA Discovery certification** along the way. But it wasnâ€™t until 2017, when I started programming with a friend using **LUA**, that I truly began to dive into the world of software development.

A year later, I decided it was time to level up. I wanted to move beyond scripting and learn a modern, powerful programming language. So, I took the plunge into **C#**, and by the end of 2018, I had become "proficient" in it, marking a pivotal moment in my journey as a developer.

In the months leading up to the pandemic, I took a programming course that expanded my skillset further, giving me a solid foundation in **C**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **Java**. But my true passion lies in creating immersive experiences. Thatâ€™s when I started experimenting with **Scaleforms** on the **FiveM platform**, combining my love for gaming with my programming skills to craft engaging, realistic interfaces for multiplayer experiences.

Itâ€™s been an exciting journey so far, and Iâ€™m still learning and evolving every day. For me, technology isnâ€™t just about writing code; itâ€™s about building something meaningful and fun, something that can bring people together and spark creativity.


Some of my most rewarding projects include:  
- **ScaleformUI:** Simplifying Menus and UI development for the FiveM community with a user-friendly API and Native visual feeling.  
- **FxEvents:** Enhancing event management to make scripting more efficient with synchronous and asynchronous events, binary serialization and more.

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring the world of **web development**, learning modern technologies to broaden my capabilities and take on exciting new challenges.

## My Story

Behind the keyboard, Iâ€™m someone who values curiosity, creativity, and connection. Growing up, I was always fascinated by how things worked, whether it was tinkering with gadgets or solving puzzles. That same curiosity eventually led me to programming, where I found a way to combine my love for logic with creativity.

Life as a developer has been an incredible journey, but I believe that true inspiration often comes from experiences outside of work. Outside of coding, Iâ€™m passionate about exploring new ideas, learning from different cultures, and pushing my own boundaries. Whether itâ€™s through reading books on technology, philosophy, or psychology, Iâ€™m always searching for new perspectives to fuel my personal growth.

Iâ€™m also a firm believer in the power of collaboration. Some of the best moments in my development journey have come from working with others, sharing ideas, and learning from one another. This has not only improved my technical skills but also taught me the importance of building strong, positive relationships within the community.

As someone who enjoys a balance between work and life, I find time to step away from the screen. Whether itâ€™s taking long walks in nature, spending time with family and friends, or exploring new hobbies, I find that these moments of downtime are just as important for nurturing creativity and maintaining a healthy mindset.

Ultimately, Iâ€™m driven by the desire to create something meaningful, whether itâ€™s a new project, a helpful tool for others, or simply an idea that inspires someone else. My journey is far from over, and Iâ€™m excited to continue learning, growing, and contributing to the world around me.

## My Philosophy

I believe that great work comes from passion and perseverance.
