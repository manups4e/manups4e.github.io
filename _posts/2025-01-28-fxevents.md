# FxEvents: An Advanced Event Subsystem for FiveM

**FxEvents** is a powerful event system for **FiveM**, providing robust features for event handling with an emphasis on security and ease of use. Whether you're building multiplayer scripts or custom client-server communication systems, FxEvents offers powerful features to enhance your development workflow.

## Features

### 1. **Robust Event Handling**
   - **Simple integration** into both client and server scripts.
   - Support for both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** events.
   - Use of **MsgPack binary serialization** for efficient and fast data transmission.
   - **Encrypted signatures** for data security and integrity.

### 2. **Automatic Event Initialization (v3.0.0+)**
   - Internal events are now **automatically generated** using SHA-256 based on the resource name and a random seed.
   - Simplified process eliminates the need for manual event initialization.

### 3. **Advanced Event Mounting**
   - Mount events using **lambda style** or classic methods for greater flexibility.
   - Support for **customizable parameters** with `FromSource` attribute for player-specific event handling.
   - The system is **not limited to specific parameters**; event parameters can now be dynamically cast between different types.

### 4. **Encryption and Anti-Tamper Features**
   - Events are safeguarded against tampering with an **anti-tamper system** that flags suspicious events.
   - The library supports **encryption and decryption** with customizable passkeys for added security.
   - Protect against attacks like **repeated messages**, **edited encrypted data**, and **public key spoofing**.

### 5. **Native ValueTuple Support**
   - FxEvents supports **ValueTuples** natively from version 3.0.0, which makes it easier to work with structured data without needing external libraries.

### 6. **Server and Client-Side Event Triggering**
   - Trigger events from both **server** and **client** sides.
   - Use the `EventHub.Send` method for both global and targeted events, including triggering for **all connected players** or specific ones.

### 7. **Event Binding Options (v3.0.0+)**
   - Define event bindings using four types: `None`, `Local`, `Remote`, and `All`.
   - More control over **how and when events are triggered** based on context.

### 8. **Support for FiveM Types**
   - Send FiveM-specific types such as **Player**, **Ped**, **Vehicle**, **Prop**, and **Entity** as event parameters.
   - Handle **networked entities** and **math structures** like Vectors and Quaternions seamlessly.

### 9. **Callbacks and Response Handling**
   - Use **callbacks** for synchronous responses from the other side.
   - Mount callbacks using either **lambda style** or with the `[FxEvent("EventName")]` attribute.

### 10. **Serialization Features**
   - Serialize and deserialize objects with built-in **ToJson()** and **FromJson()** methods.
   - Convert objects to and from **byte arrays** using **ToBytes()** and **FromBytes()**.
   - Support for **encryption** during serialization with the `EncryptObject()` and `DecryptObject()` methods.

### 11. **Easy Debugging and Customization**
   - Includes extensive debugging tools, like the ability to generate **SHA-256 hashes** for custom data, making it easier to track event integrity.
   - Convert **byte arrays** to readable strings and vice versa using `BytesToString()` and `StringToBytes()`.

### 12. **Community and Support**
   - For more details, **join our Discord server** to ask questions, request support, or share your ideas with other developers.
   - If you find this library useful, consider supporting me via **PayPal**—you can buy a coffee, a donut, or even a Tesla!

## Usage Example

To integrate **FxEvents** into your project, you’ll need to initialize it first and mount events for your specific use cases. Below is an example of how to get started:

### Initialize FxEvents:

```csharp
public class Main : BaseScript
{
    public Main()
    {
        // Initialize the FxEvents library. Call this once at script start to enable EventHub usage anywhere.
        EventHub.Initialize();
    }
}
```

### Mounting an Event:
```csharp
EventHub.Mount("eventName", Binding.All, new Action<ISource, string, int>(([FromSource] source, string val1, int val2) =>    
{
    // Code to execute inside the event.
    Logger.Info($"Event triggered with values: {val1}, {val2}");
}));
```

### Conclusion

FxEvents provides a comprehensive, flexible, and secure event-handling system for FiveM developers. With its advanced features such as encryption, MsgPack serialization, and anti-tampering, it ensures efficient and safe communication across client-server boundaries in multiplayer environments.
