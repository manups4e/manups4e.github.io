# ScaleformUI: A Library for Creating Rockstar-like Menus

**ScaleformUI** is a custom-built library designed to help developers quickly create **Rockstar-like menus**, such as pause menus and lobby systems, for **FiveM** projects.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:**  
- You can freely use this library in your resources, but **you cannot include it in any paid resources**. If you're selling a resource that uses ScaleformUI, make sure to mention this repository in your script's requirements.
